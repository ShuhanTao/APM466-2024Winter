\begin{enumerate}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Excessive money printing leads to inflation and undermines confidence in a country's currency, issuing bonds allows the government to raise funds while maintaining control over monetary policy and confidence in the currency.
        \item Assume a situation where an economy has been experiencing strong economic growth accompanied by low employment and moderate inflation, the long-term yields are less attractive to the pessimistic investors. To prevent the economy from overheating and to control inflation, the central bank gradually raises short-term interest rates, investors anticipate continued interest rate hikes by the central bank and therefore seek safety and stability in the midst of uncertainty and therefore turn to long-term bond holdings, this increase in the demand for long-term bonds pushed up their price and yields fall.
        \item Quantitative easing is a monetary policy tool used by central banks to stimulate the economy by purchasing government securities or other financial assets from the market, to lower long-term interest rates, to increase money supply, and to encourage borrowing and investment, thereby boosting economic activity and inflation. Since March 2020, the Federal Reserve has committed to purchasing large quantities of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to inject liquidity into the financial markets and support lending activity. 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Since the government of Canada issues its bonds with a semi-annual coupon, I try to pick bonds that the maturity dates of which have a half year gap hence the yields are easier to compare. And the data is evenly distributed. The selected bonds are listed below, since the last one of ideal bonds cannot be found, I chose a closed one matures on June 1 instead.

    \item Eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each eigenvector or direction on the curve. Larger eigenvalues indicate greater variability, and smaller eigenvalues indicate less variability. Eigenvectors represent the direction or pattern of motion on the curve that explains the most variance. Each eigenvector points in a particular direction along the curve, indicating the interrelationship of the stochastic processes in terms of motion or fluctuation. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors associated with the covariance matrices of a number of stochastic processes can tell us about the variability and direction of motion along a stochastic curve.

        I chose to use linear interpolation because it's straightforward and computationally efficient.
        \\ First, the 10 selected bonds' ytm is shown below:
